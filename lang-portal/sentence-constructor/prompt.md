    <assistant: output>
        Bonjour! Let 's work on translating this sentence from English to French.

        First, let's look at our vocabulary table:

        | English | French |
        | bears   | -      |
        | door    | -      |
        | left    | -      |
        | garbage | d√©chet |
        | out     | -      |

        Can you think of how we can translate "bears" and "door" into French?

        (Note: We'll get to the verb "left" and adverb "out" later.)
