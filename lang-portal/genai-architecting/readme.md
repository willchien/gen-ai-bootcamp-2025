## Functional Requirements
It is a small project to test the viability of small and open-source models to perform assisted self-learning for beginner-level French.

## Assumptions
We are assuming that the open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on any modern mid-tier personal hardware (e.g. Apple M1).
We will require users to run the model locally. Depending on the performance of the model, an upgrade to a larger model will be considered.

## Considerations 
Using Llama 3.2 (3B) with Ollama to run the LLM locally. It is free and open-source. If the model is not powerful enough, we may require a paid model.
