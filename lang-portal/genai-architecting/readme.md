## Functional Requirements

e.g. the compnay wants to invest in owning their infrastructure. The reason is beacuse there is a concern about the privacy of user data and also that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly raise in cost. They want to ivnest an AI PC where they can afford spend of 10-15k. They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions
e.g. we are assuming that the open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enought to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k. 
e.g. we will have a single server in our office to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy
e.g. Copywrighted materials.

## Conisderations 
e.g. considering using IBM granite because of its open-source model. the training data is traceable, therefore avoid copyright issues.
